  * as described by http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html

    To rank items with positive/negative ratings (Bernoulli trials),

  * implementation suggested in: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687497/objective-c-implementation-of-the-wilson-score-interval

* building
  make clean all test

* perl api
  confidence_interval::wilson_lower_bound(2*$i, 10*$i, 0.1);
